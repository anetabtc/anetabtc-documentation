This bridge aims to provide BTC holders with the ability to deploy their capital in ways not previously available on the BTC blockchain, while also increasing liquidity and native asset value on both the Cardano and Ergo networks. In turn, this will benefit all three communities.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"get-started/Follow":{"id":"get-started/Follow","title":"Follow Us","description":"Chat with our team and community members as anetaBTC brings DeFi to Ergo and Cardano.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"get-started/Introduction":{"id":"get-started/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"AnetaBTC is a protocol that allows Bitcoin to be directly wrapped on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. This allows Bitcoin holders to access the full value of their assets in a secure and efficient manner, enabling them to utilize Cardano and Ergo decentralized exchanges (DEXs), participate in lending protocols, and more, without having to sell any Bitcoin. AnetaBTC serves a similar purpose to wBTC, which is a 1:1 BTC-backed token on the Ethereum blockchain. wBTC is currently the largest wrapped Bitcoin protocol, with over $4 billion of locked Bitcoin value. However, unlike wBTC, the AnetaBTC protocol will evolve to become fully decentralized through three distinct versions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"get-started/litepaper":{"id":"get-started/litepaper","title":"Litepaper","description":"AnetaBTC is a fully on-chain, decentralized protocol that allows Bitcoin to be directly wrapped on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. AnetaBTC enables Bitcoin holders to unlock the value of their assets in a secure and efficient environment to provide yield, without selling any Bitcoin and without any third-party custodian involvement, as in the case of wBTC which is on the Ethereum blockchain and is the largest wrapped Bitcoin protocol today with over $14 billion of locked Bitcoin value.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"get-started/tokenomics":{"id":"get-started/tokenomics","title":"Tokenomics","description":"There are a combined total of two billion (2,000,000,000) anetaBTC protocol tokens and is hard-capped at this amount.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/explain":{"id":"protocol-overview/explain","title":"Version 1-3 High Level","description":"AnetaBTC is a research-driven protocol. The birth of AnetaBTC is the combination of concepts from research papers including, but not limited to, Bitcoin, wBTC, REN, Ergo, and Interlay. The key part of our approach is writing smart contracts that send Bitcoin to a vault if a user wants to mint anetaBTC. Upon minting, users will be able to freely use anetaBTC as a Bitcoin-backed asset on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/open-source":{"id":"protocol-overview/open-source","title":"Open Source","description":"We are built on the foundations of transparency, open source code, and Know Your Assumptions (KYA).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/v1":{"id":"protocol-overview/v1","title":"V1 Technical Architecture","description":"Our technical architecture is designed to prioritize security while also providing an enjoyable user experience when minting and redeeming eBTC.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/v2":{"id":"protocol-overview/v2","title":"V2 Technical Architecture","description":"V2 is built using the Rosen framework, which comes with enhanced decentralization, as a group of well-known projects have custody of the vaults, as opposed to V1, which is in the custody of the anetaBTC team.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol-overview/v3":{"id":"protocol-overview/v3","title":"V3 Technical Architecture","description":"V3 will be most decentralized where anyone can run a vault by providing collateral. V3\u2019s solution is inspired by the Xclaim whitepaper, where vault operators have a vested interest in maintaining the security of the protocol. Vault operators have the ability to act maliciously, but would lose their collateral, which is less than the amount of BTC they have in their custody. In this case, effected users receive more tokens than the amount of BTC they minted on the protocol.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-guides/liso":{"id":"user-guides/liso","title":"Stake Pool Offering (LISO)","description":"At this time, NETA1 and NETA2 stake pools are open to delegation and are operating as normal staking pools with a 5% pool fee.
