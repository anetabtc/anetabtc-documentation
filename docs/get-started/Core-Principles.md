# Core Principles

The AnetaBTC protocol has been developed to establish a seamless and decentralized value transfer between the Bitcoin network, the Cardano network, and the Ergo network. This bridge aims to provide BTC holders with the ability to deploy their capital in ways not previously available on the BTC blockchain, while also increasing liquidity and native asset value on both the Cardano and Ergo networks. In turn, this will benefit all three communities.

A key principle of AnetaBTC is Know Your Assumptions (KYA). With any protocol, there are always varying degrees of decentralization. Regardless if something is optimally decentralized or completely centralized, the most important factor is for users to know all security and risk assumptions associated with interacting with the protocol.

As such, all AneteBTC versions are intended to be clearly explained and highlight the security assumptions associated with using each version. That, combined with completely open source code, creates a transparent environment for interacting with the protocol â€” built on clear assumptions. 

We uphold the core principles outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin white paper and believe that true decentralization is fundamental to blockchain technology. We are dedicated to enhancing the lives of individuals worldwide by contributing to our shared vision of a world-class decentralized finance experience. We believe that blockchain technology has the power to bring people together and share in the success of a project, and our mission is to foster this new paradigm of shared effort and innovation.
