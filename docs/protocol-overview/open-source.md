# Open Source

We are built on the foundations of transparency, open source code, and Know Your Assumptions (KYA). 

All anetaBTC code is either already open source, or will be open source following proper documentation and audits. 

We believe open source code is fundamental for progressing the blockchain industry and aligning the values of decentralized and transparency. 

For all versions, anetaBTC is committed to writing open source code and fostering full KYA to have transparent security assumptions for interacting with the anetaBTC protocol and ultimately protect users.
