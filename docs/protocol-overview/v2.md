# V2 Technical Architecture

V2 is built using the Rosen framework, which comes with enhanced decentralization, as a group of well-known projects have custody of the vaults, as opposed to V1, which is in the custody of the anetaBTC team.

A full technical breakdown of the Rosen architecture can be found on their Github [here](https://github.com/rosen-bridge).

Our implementation requires some tweaks to this code. 

First, the Rosen Bridge is initially built for an ADA-ERG bridge, using smart contracts on the Ergo network. 

For our ERG-BTC bridge, we’ll need to update all of the configurations to be compatible with BTC instead of ADA. This will require different nodes, wallets, and multisigs. 

Even more changes are required for the ADA-BTC bridge because all of the contracts for Rosen bridge are on the Ergo blockchain. We are writing smart contracts on Cardano to have the same functionality as the Ergo contracts. 

After a successful V2 integration, we’ll focus on delivering the final version, V3, which thus far has been the most researched and perfected. A breakdown on the differences of V2 and V3 can be found [here](https://medium.com/@anetaBTC/rosen-bridge-vs-interlay-an-analysis-on-wrapping-bitcoin-c9ae84da0e9d).
