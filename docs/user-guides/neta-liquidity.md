# NETA Liquidity Fund

The NETA Liquidity Fund is a community owned fund where cNETA and NETA token holders collectively have 100% ownership rights of the NETA Liquidity Fund according to token ownership interest. The NETA Liquidity Fund currently holds assets including ADA, MIN, ERG, ErgoPad, cNETA, NETA, and more.

The NETA Liquidity Fund has the potential to serve multiple functions for the anetaBTC project. Assets within the fund will be used to provide liquidity on Cardano and Ergo DEXs, potentially increasing the funds holdings over time. The Fund may also be used for bounty programs during protocol security testing, as well as for development funding if need be.
