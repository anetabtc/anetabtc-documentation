# Stake Pool Offering (LISO)

At this time, NETA1 and NETA2 stake pools are open to delegation and are operating as normal staking pools with a 5% pool fee. Delegators may choose to delegate to NETA1 and/or NETA2 to assist with protocol development. Our LISO (Liquidity Initial Stakepool Offering) program, which distributed NETA and cNETA in return for a higher pool fee, is not currently operational.
