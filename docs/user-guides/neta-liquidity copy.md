# Use Cases

## Bitcoin for Everyday Transactions

Bob wants to send Bitcoin to Alice on 10 different occasions throughout each month. Bob could send his Bitcoin on its native protocol and could expect to pay about $2.50 per transaction, about $25 per month, assuming the transaction fee remains at that price. Bob could also hypothetically transact with Alice using wBTC on the Ethereum network, but the current cost to complete an Ethereum transaction is $40.11, which would amount to over $400 per month to send all of his transactions. Another option Bob has is anetaBTC, where he can send Alice ten transactions a month of his Bitcoin and would pay the transaction fee on Ergo, which at the time of this writing, is 0.001 ERG. At the time of this writing, this would mean the average transaction would be just below $0.01. If Bob were to send Alice anetaBTC on ten different occasions throughout the month, Bob would pay about $0.10 in total transaction fees on Ergo.

## Privacy Tools and Taproot

Bob wants to securely store his Bitcoin on a protocol that is decentralized, is equipped with security features, and has flexible privacy tools readily available. Bitcoin’s native protocol may serve Bob well in terms of decentralization and security, however, Bob may not have access to many privacy tools and yield-producing DeFi products.

Bob may feel optimistic about his ability to safely and reliably access privacy tools through Bitcoin’s recent soft fork upgrade, Taproot. It should be noted, however, that the Taproot Upgrade does not increase privacy for the average user, but rather, degrades privacy significantly.

We agree with Nikita Zhavoronkov, CEO and lead developer at Blockchair, a leading search and analytics engine platform for many leading blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin and Cardano, who published a critique on Taproot, titled “Negative Impact of Taproot on Bitcoin’s Privacy” in November 2020.

Miners are the only ones who decided to implement the Taproot Upgrade for everyone. Miners of Bitcoin will make decisions that are in their best interest, and not the average user of Bitcoin. It is fairly common knowledge that all ASIC mining equipment required to mine Bitcoin today is almost entirely produced in the People’s Republic of China.

For the most part, all NASDAQ-listed Bitcoin mining companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA), Riot Blockchain ($RIOT), and Canaan ($CAN) procure all their mining equipment from China. Together, these NASDAQ listed companies in addition to the China-based ASIC manufacturers such as Bitmain that operate some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools in existence compose a majority of mining voting power to decide on upgrades to Bitcoin’s protocol.

Using anetaBTC, however, would allow Bob to seamlessly access Ergo’s community-built privacy tools such as ErgoMixer. ErgoMixer is the first non-interactive, non-custodial mixer in existence. ErgoScript, the smart contract language of Ergo, supports non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called Σ-protocols (Sigma Protocols) with flexibility allowing for ring-signatures, multi signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

Bob now has the ability to securely and reliably protect his anetaBTC privately and has a sound reason to store the value of his Bitcoin on the Ergo platform utilizing anetaBTC.

## Bitcoin DeFi with Ergo and Cardano

Bob holds anetaBTC and wants to trade it for ERG. AnetaBTC is an Ergo native asset meaning Bob can seamlessly trade his anetaBTC for ERG and all other assets that are traded on decentralized exchanges that are interoperable with Ergo and Cardano assets.

Bob has multiple other options in terms of how he can use his Bitcoin on Ergo and Cardano. Say Bob is holding anetaBTC and decides he wants to earn interest on his anetaBTC, he can participate in various liquidity-providing protocols such as Ergo’s novel oracle pools. Bob will potentially have the opportunity to provide liquidity in different pools such as anetaBTC/ERG, anetaBTC/ADA, anetaBTC/SigUSD, and anetaBTC/ETH.

There are currently two active oracle pools, ERG/SigUSD and ETH/SigUSD, which are run collectively by the Ergo community. Instead of participating in the community-run oracle pools, Bob decides he wants to take out a loan and use his anetaBTC as collateral.

When lending infrastructure is built on Ergo, Bob can take a loan against his anetaBTC. For example, he has 1 anetaBTC and is offered an LTV of 25%, which at current prices would be 14,250 SigUSD at a 1% interest rate. Bob will have the ability to use his anetaBTC for many DeFi applications built on Ergo and Cardano.
